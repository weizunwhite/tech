- Subtitle / tagline describing core approach
- Student name placeholder: `[姓名]`
- Grade level (e.g., 五年级)
- School name placeholder: `[学校名称]`
- Brand icon (theme-specific)

### Slide 2: Project Origin / Problem (~25s)

**Purpose:** Emotional hook. Why did the student start this project?

**Required elements:**
- Personal story or real-world observation
- The "aha moment" — what sparked the idea
- The decision to act

**Content pattern (3-part story):**
1. **Event/Observation** (red/accent1): What happened or what was noticed
2. **Thinking** (blue/accent3): The question that formed in the student's mind
3. **Action** (orange/accent2): The decision to create a solution

**Photo suggestion:** Field investigation, the problem scene, student sketching ideas

**Grade-level adaptation:**
- Elementary: "我看到了...我想到了...我决定..."
- Middle: More analytical framing of the problem

---

### Slide 3: Background Research (~25s)

**Purpose:** Show the student did real investigation, not just built something.

**Required elements:**
- 3-4 key statistics or findings from research
- Evidence of field work (photos of investigation)
- Why existing solutions are insufficient

**Data presentation:**
- Use Hero Number layout (Content-E) or Card Grid (Content-A)
- Each stat: big number + label + color coding
- Include source context (e.g., "调查了5个小区")

**Speaker note emphasis:** "I went and investigated myself" — stress personal research effort

---

### Slide 4: System Architecture (~30s)

**Purpose:** Give the big picture before diving into details.

**Required elements:**
- Overall system diagram showing major components
- Communication flow between components
- Key technology labels (protocols, platforms)

**Layout:** Use Flow-A (three boxes) or Flow-B (center hub) depending on system structure

**Complexity by grade:**
- Elementary: 2-3 simple blocks with arrows, everyday language
- Middle: Can include protocol names, more technical labels

---

### Slide 5: Component A Detail (~25s)

**Purpose:** Deep dive into first major component.

**Required elements:**
- Component photo
- Key specifications or features (3-4 items)
- Why this component was chosen

**Layout:** Use Content-B (photo + list) or Content-A (card grid)

**For hardware projects:** Show sensors, modules, their specs
**For software projects:** Show UI screenshots, algorithm visualization

---

### Slide 6: Component B Detail (~30s)

**Purpose:** Deep dive into second major component.

**IMPORTANT:** Use a DIFFERENT layout than Slide 5 to maintain visual variety.

**Required elements:**
- Component photo (different angle from slide 5)
- Core design features (3-4 items)
- Highlight the most creative/innovative design decision

**Layout:** If slide 5 used Content-B, use Content-A here (or vice versa)

---

### Slide 7: Making Process (~25s)

**Purpose:** Show the journey of building — evidence of hands-on work.

**Required elements:**
- 3 phases/stages of construction
- Process photos (soldering, 3D printing, assembly, testing)
- Brief description of what was done in each phase

**Layout:** Content-D (timeline/process) — 3 columns

**Photo priority order:**
1. Hands-on construction photos (student working)
2. Component assembly shots
3. 3D design screenshots
4. Circuit testing photos

---

### Slide 8: Difficulties & Solutions (~25s)

**Purpose:** Prove problem-solving ability — most important for scoring.

**Required elements:**
- 3 specific difficulties encountered
- Corresponding solutions (must be student-derived)
- At least one solution should connect to school knowledge (e.g., physics, math)

**Layout:** Content-C (comparison arrows) — problem → solution pairs

**Color coding:**
- Problem cards: warm/red background tint
- Solution cards: cool/green background tint
- Arrow connector between each pair

**Speaker note emphasis:** The MOST IMPRESSIVE difficulty-solution pair should get the most speaking time and be described with the most detail.

---

### Slide 9: Testing & Results (~30s)

**Purpose:** Prove the project works with data.

**Required elements:**
- Key metrics (number of tests, success rate, response time, error rate)
- Test photo or diagram
- Test procedure summary

**Layout:** Content-E (hero numbers) — big stats at top, photo + flow below

**Metric formatting:**
- Use theme accent colors for different metrics
- Largest/most impressive number gets the most visual weight
- Include units and context (e.g., "58次" not just "58")

---

### Slide 10: Innovation Points (~25s)

**Purpose:** Explicitly state what's new and valuable.

**Required elements:**
- 4-6 innovation points with short descriptions
- Future improvement directions

**Layout:** Content-A (card grid) — 2×3 or 3×2

**Innovation point formula:**
- Title: 4-6 characters (e.g., "多传感器融合")
- Description: 1-2 lines explaining why it's innovative

**Future improvements section:** Horizontal bar at bottom with 3-4 future directions

---

### Slide 11: Personal Contribution (~25s)

**Purpose:** Prove authenticity. Critical for competition credibility.

**Required elements:**
- 5-6 specific personal contributions with descriptions
- Bottom disclaimer about teacher guidance

**Layout:** Content-A (card grid) — 2×3 grid with numbered circles

**Contribution categories to cover:**
1. Research / Investigation (调研)
2. Creative design decisions (设计决策)
3. Physical construction (动手制作)
4. Programming (编程)
5. Testing & iteration (测试迭代)
6. Self-learning new skills (自学新技能)

**Bottom text (italic, muted):**
> 指导老师提供方向建议，所有设计、制作、编程、测试均由我独立完成

---

### Slide 12: Reflections & Learnings (~25s)

**Purpose:** Emotional closing. What the student gained beyond the product.

**Required elements:**
- One powerful quote/statement (the "golden sentence")
- 3-4 specific things learned (skills + mindset)

**Layout:** Closing-A (dark background) or Closing-B (light cards)

**The golden sentence should:**
- Connect classroom knowledge to real-world impact
- Be memorable and quotable
- Sound like a genuine student reflection, not an adult's words

**Example golden sentences:**
- "课堂上学的知识，真的可以用来解决生活中的真实问题。"
- "最难的不是技术，而是不放弃的勇气。"
- "从一个想法到一个真正能用的东西，每一步都在学习。"

## Grade-Level Language Guide

### Elementary (小学 1-6年级)
- 口语化：像讲故事一样
- 用"我"开头：我发现、我想到、我学会了
- 避免生僻技术词，用日常语言解释
- 允许表达情感：害怕、兴奋、自豪
- 句子短，节奏明快

### Middle School (初中 7-9年级)
- 可以使用技术术语，但首次出现要简单解释
- 更注重逻辑推理过程
- 数据描述更精确
- 仍然保持第一人称叙述
- 可以适当引用文献资料
